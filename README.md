# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

In my assignment project, I have used the useState hook to manage the state of the following:

- allcardData : this state use for when The data will be loaded in fetch method, then stored here. and the stored data send to card section .

- chartItems : it is use for when any user select any card for add to chart , then selected card data store here and send to chart component for showing display .

- totalRemainIng :this state Accumulates the number of hours the user is authorized to select courses. and send to chart component stored data for showing in display .

- totalCraditHours :it is use for the total number of hours a user has selected courses, storeing here. then send to chart component for shoing disply .

I have used the addToChart function to add a course to the cart. This function takes the unique ID of the course as an argument and updates the chartItems state accordingly.

I have also used the allreadyAdd, remainingTimeFinish and Total_Credit_Hour functions to display toast messages if I try to add a course that would exceed the remaining credit hours or the total credit hours or select second time.

Overall, I have used the useState hook effectively to manage the state of my application. The code is well-organized and easy to understand.
